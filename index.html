            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
            physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
            appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
            equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some
            exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang.
            Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to
            begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
            evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
            that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
            faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
            instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
            the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a
            jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all
            the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
            missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
            ocean.
          </p>
          <p>
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
            page and drew a double box around it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
            reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
            that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
            right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to
            <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes
            at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of
            the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples
            in the fabric of space-time — so-called
            <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a
            universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
            trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They
            are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
            Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years,
            though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever
            be proved.
          </p>
          <p>
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
            science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
            pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
            open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
            speculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
            extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
            billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
            cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
            Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless
            number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a
            pot of pasta water boiling over.
          </p>
          <h2>‘As Big as It Gets’</h2>
          <p>
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
            accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity
            itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct
            observation of gravitational waves, which, according to
            Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle
            space-time.
          </p>
          <p>
              Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
              expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
              as it gets.”
          </p>
          <p>
              He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
              sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
            bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
            picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
            as the surface of the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known
            as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic
            Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at
            the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of
            papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

              <span>INFLATION</span>  solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.

              <span>FLUCTUATION</span>  Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

              <span>EXPANSION</span>  Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.
